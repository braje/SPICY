Questions about the real-world model for Ben Kaiser during phone conversation on 9/12.

* Why are keys both environments and return arguments?
* Can you sketch out the step relationship, especially the unwritten commands (Return, Bind, BindSymKey, BindAsymKey, Barrier). I'd like to talk at the level of operational semantics.
* Why is the message heap an ```fmap var message ```instead of ```list (var * message)``` to prevent overwrites?

# Secure Protocols Implemented CorrectlY (SPICY)

This repository contains the main developments of the SPICY protocol development and specification tool.

## Repository Layout

This repository has three top-level directories:
* Frap -- we bootstrapped the project by using some developments from the FRAP library
* src -- core library code, including Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), their semantics, and the safety theorem
* protocols -- several test protocols proven correct

Some good places to start to get a feel for the formalized languages and main safety result:

* src/IdealWorld.v -- formalization of the Ideal World language.
* src/RealWorld.v -- formalization of the Real World language.
* src/Simulation.v -- development of our simulation statements between the Ideal and Real worlds (the actual simulation definitions can be found in the "Simulation" section).
* src/AdversarySafety.v -- the main theorems and lemmas stating the safety result.

The main safety results within AdversarySafety warrant some further discussion.
The last theorem (`refines_could_generate`) is the statement that if a Real
World protocol refines an Ideal World protocol, then traces in the Real World
can be reproduced in the Ideal World. A few hundred lines up from there, in
`refines_ok_with_adversary` is the main lemma supporting
`refines_could_generate` where we show that, starting from a refinement
condition in a universe with no adversary, we can inject arbitrary adversary
code and obtain a refinement condition within this new universe.

Using the above library code, we have verified several exemplar protocols.

* protocols/PGP.v (protocol impl) and protocols/Verification/PGPSecure.v (correctness proof) -- describes a secret sharing protocol inspired by the PGP protocol.
* protocols/SecureDNS.v (protocol impl) and protocols/Verification/SecureDNSSecure.v (correctness proof) -- describes a protocol similar in spirit to (but much simplified) Daniel Bernstein's DNSCurve for encrypted DNS.
* protocols/AvgSalary.v and protocols/Verification/AvgSalarySecure.v -- describes a simple aggregation service, interesting because it involves more than two parties.
* protocols/P2P.v and protocols/Verification/P2PSecure.v -- describes a network authentication protocol by a trusted third party showing an alternative way of bootstrapping trusted keys

## Setup

Setup notes for future me.

### Installing coq

Make sure coq is installed an on the path.  I find it convenient to
install via opam, using switches.  Some quick notes on how to do that:

The *first* time you use opam, you need to set up your environment.

```bash
opam init

opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released --set-default
```

Now, whenever you want to install a new version, just do:

```bash
opam update

opam switch create coq-8.13.2 ocaml-base-compiler.4.11.1

opam install coq.8.13.2
opam pin add coq 8.13.2
```

### Compiling Project

```bash
git clone <url>

# Pull in submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Compiles the faster paper example protocol
make paper-fast

# Compiles all paper example protocols
make paper-all
```
